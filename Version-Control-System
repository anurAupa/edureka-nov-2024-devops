why VCS?
1. To track changes --> who committed the changes, and when the commit was change?
2. To retrieve accidental deletes

2 types of VCS:
1. Centralized VCS --> svn
2. Distributed VCS --> GIT

2 drawbacks for centralised VCS
1. internet connection all the time
2. multiple developers cann't work on same file
