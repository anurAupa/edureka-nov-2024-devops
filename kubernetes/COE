Docker --> Container Engine --> 2015

Container Orchestration Engine --> Kubernetes, Docker Swarm

K8s --> google --> 2015
  
2005 - 2015 --> Borg

COE Features
------------
1. auto-scaling of pods --> hpa (horizontal pod autoscaler) (k8s object)
2. auto-healing of pods --> rs (replica set) (k8s object)
3. auto-load-balancing of requests across all the pods/nodes --> svc (service) (k8s object)
4. auto-deployment without downtime --> deploy (deployment) (K8s)
5. auto-scheduling and auto-clustering --> nodeselector, taints, tolerance (K8s)

Kubernetes ~ k8s

Master Node
worker nodes --> VMs --> K8s objects get deployed in worker nodes

K8s objects:
* Pods --> have containers, 1 Pod --> 1 container
* ReplicaSet
* Deployment
* Services --> to expose the pods --> 
    loadbalancer --> load balances the traffic across multiple nodes
    NodePort --> exposes front-end pods
    ClusterIP --> front-end pods and backend pods communication

K8s Architecture
API Server ---> Gatekeeper
Scheduler --> schedules K8s objects on nodes
Controller Manager --> Overall health of the cluster
etcd --> database --> lighweight, centralized, distributed, key-value pair DB

Kubelet --> makes sure containers are runnig healthy
kube-proxy --> core networking component in the cluster


AWS --> EKS --> eksctl create cluster
Azure --> AKS
GCP --> GKE
Oracle --> OKE
